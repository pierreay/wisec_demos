# Demos list

## Old

1. OpenBTS, I have some vm and scrips and docs for it in this repo, but there is
   also a lot online.
2. Screaming channels, see screaming channels repo (same for Noise-SDR)
3. Fingerprinting: I pushed something, but the original was this one 
   https://www.rtl-sdr.com/fingerprinting-electronic-devices-via-their-rf-emissions-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-imagemagick/
   maybe you can find something better, this is nice because it is extremely
simple
4. TEMPEST: check
   https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tempestsdr-a-sdr-tool-for-eavesdropping-on-computer-screens-via-unintentionally-radiated-rf/,
   it is a bit annoying to use but it works.
   Alternatively, there is gr-tempest in gnuradio but I never really tried it.
5. Relay: Aurélien has the cable
6. Then maybe some fingerprinting of wifi scans from phones and laptops,
   but it was not great 
7. Replay: using URH, record a command from the clicker and send it later to 
   move the slides. Extra: when Aurélien shows the microphone it is also
   possible to record that and replay the audio.
8. Soft-TEMPEST: just search "tempest for elize" on youtube, use an RTL-SDR
   to pick the leak, demodulate and play the sound.
   Ofc you could also use noise-sdr for the leak, but the video
   is maybe easier and simpler to show.

## Ideas:

1. Semoo lab has a lot of material, maybe cool to show something with BLE
