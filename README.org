** PROG GPS: Spoofing

Seems to be an experiment from Giovanni in the R2Lab's anechoic chamber.

** PROG RF: Fingerprinting

The original was this one : https://www.rtl-sdr.com/fingerprinting-electronic-devices-via-their-rf-emissions-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-imagemagick/
Maybe you can find something better, this is nice because it is extremely simple.

** PROG RF: TempestSDR

The original was this one : https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tempestsdr-a-sdr-tool-for-eavesdropping-on-computer-screens-via-unintentionally-radiated-rf/
It is a bit annoying to use but it works.
Alternatively, there is =gr-tempest= in GNURadio but I never really tried it.
It seems that Giovanni also tried : https://github.com/martinmarinov/TempestSDR

** PROG RF: Soft-TEMPEST

Just search "TEMPEST For Elize" on YouTube, use an RTL-SDR to pick the leak, demodulate and play the sound.
Of course you could also use Noise-SDR for the leak, but the video is maybe easier and simpler to show.

** PROG RF: Relay

Aur√©lien has the cable.

** PROG RF: Replay

Using URH, record a command from the clicker and send it later to move the slides.

** PROG GSM: OpenBTS

There is some VM, scripts and docs for it in this repo, but there is also a lot online.

** TODO ZigBee: TODO

** TODO BLE: Reactive Jamming

** TODO BLE: Packet Injection
