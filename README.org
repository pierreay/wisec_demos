** DONE RF - Clicker

Perform a replay attack on a unprotected clicker.

- Directory: [[file:rf-clicker/]]

** DONE RF - Etherify

Exfiltrate a secret in Morse Code through an covert-channel based on Ethernet link mode.

- Prerequisites :
  1. One computer connected with an Ethernet cable to an internet box OR two
     computers connected with an Ethernet cable to each others.
  2. One SDR (from RTL-SDR to USRP).
  3. GQRX and sudo permissions.

** NEXT RF: Fingerprinting

The original was this one : https://www.rtl-sdr.com/fingerprinting-electronic-devices-via-their-rf-emissions-with-an-rtl-sdr-and-imagemagick/
Maybe you can find something better, this is nice because it is extremely simple.

** NEXT RF: TempestSDR

The original was this one : https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tempestsdr-a-sdr-tool-for-eavesdropping-on-computer-screens-via-unintentionally-radiated-rf/
It is a bit annoying to use but it works.
Alternatively, there is =gr-tempest= in GNURadio but I never really tried it.
It seems that Giovanni also tried : https://github.com/martinmarinov/TempestSDR

** NEXT RF: Soft-TEMPEST

Just search "TEMPEST For Elize" on YouTube, use an RTL-SDR to pick the leak, demodulate and play the sound.
Of course you could also use Noise-SDR for the leak, but the video is maybe easier and simpler to show.

** NEXT RF: Replay

1. Using URH, record a command from the clicker and send it later to move the
   slides :

2. Using URH, record a command from a connected electrical relay and send it
   later to turn it ON, with a light, a beeper, or an alarm connected to the
   relay.
