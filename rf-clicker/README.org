* About

Demo about performing a replay attack on a clicker.

It is a Kensington Wireless Presenter ([[https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B000FPGP4U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1][old version without AES]]) ([[https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Wireless-Presenter-Receiver-Presentation/dp/B087JDNZ49][new version
with AES]]) composed of a remote controller and a USB dongle. The operation
frequency is printed on the USB dongle.

The old dongles doesn't have any protections, however, recent dongles are
described as protected by an AES-128 bits.

* Observe the signal

1. Launch [[shell:gqrx -r &]] and connect to a USRP B200-mini.
2. Tune at 2.407 GHz with 5 MSPS and a PGA gain to 60 db.
3. Click on a button of the remote controller: you should see a wideband signal
   (1 MHz bandwidth signal) on the waterfall (and your selected slider on GQRX
   could move).

Note: you could do this with URH instead of QGRX directly with =File= ->
=Spectrum Analyzer=.

* Replay attack

1. [[shell:urh &]].
2. =File= -> =Record signal=.
3. Record the signal according to parameters:
   [[file:imgs/urh_recording.png]]
4. Save the signal.
5. Under =Interpretation= tab, click on the arrow =Replay signal=.
6. Enter the same parameters as recording:
   - Device :: USRP
   - Antenna :: Antenna 1
   - Frequency (Hz) :: 2,407G
   - Sample rate (Sps) :: 2.0M
   - Bandwidth (Hz) :: 2.0M
   - Gain :: 70
   - Repeat :: 1
7. Press =Start= button and put slides as active window. Happy replay!
